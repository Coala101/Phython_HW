# read input
- from util import read_input
- read_input(too stupid for that)
- create dictionary Rosalind...: DNA
- all_dna={}
for word in gc:
    all_dna[word[1:14:]]=word[15::]

# count Cs and Gs in each string of dictionary
- for loop with if conditions? I dont know how to... im stuck with how to get the keys and values sepparately
- if there is a C or G - add to a value?
- if there is A or T - add to another value...

- then maybe value2/value1 for every string with a for loop again? - new variable
- I dont know how to combine it but another if loop - if one, bigger than other, keep that one or something.
- at the end print the variable of the biggest percentage
